1. **docker run -d --name=my_ubuntu**
   - That's right! This `-d` flag starts the container in the background, and `--name=my_ubuntu` names the container "my_ubuntu".
____
2. **docker run -p 8080:80 --name=my_nginx nginx**
   - Correct! The `-p 8080:80` flag propagates port 8080 on the host machine to port 80 in the container, and `--name=my_nginx` names the container "my_nginx".
___
3. **docker run mysql, docker logs -f**
   - A bit of a misunderstanding. The commands are comma-separated, but it would be better to use `docker run` with the `-d` flag to start the MySQL container in the background, and then use `docker logs -f <container_id>` to view the container logs in real time.
___
4. **docker images -a**
   - That's right, this `-a` flag displays a list of all Docker images, including intermediate images.
___
5. **docker run python -it**
   - Correct! The `-it` flag starts the container in interactive mode and connects to its terminal, which is especially useful for running Python commands.
____
6. **docker rmi $(docker images -aq)**
   That's right! The -a flag outputs all available images on your computer, the -q flag outputs the IDs of the images, allowing you to pass them to the **docker rmi** command
