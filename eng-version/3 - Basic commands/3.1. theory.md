### Basic Docker Commands:

Docker provides a set of command line commands for managing Docker containers, images, and other Docker resources.

#### Some basic Docker commands:

1. **docker run:**.
   - Command to create and run a container based on a Docker image.
   - Example: `docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx` - starts a container with NGINX web server and forwards port 8080 to the host machine.

2. **docker pull:**
   - Command to download a Docker image from Docker Hub or other repository.
   - Example: `docker pull ubuntu` - downloads the latest Ubuntu image from Docker Hub.

3. **docker build:**
   - Command to build a Docker image based on a Dockerfile.
   - Example: `docker build -t myapp .` - builds a Docker image named "myapp" from the current directory.

4. **docker ps:**
   - Command to display a list of running containers.
   - Example: `docker ps` - displays a list of current containers.

5. **docker images:**
   - Command to display a list of Docker images available on your host.
   - Example: `docker images` - displays a list of all available images.

6. **docker logs:**
   - Command to view the container logs.
   - Example: `docker logs <container_id>` - displays logs for the container with the specified identifier.

7. **docker rm:**
   - The `docker rm` command is used to remove one or more stopped containers from local Docker storage. 

8. **docker rmi:**
   -The `docker rmi` command is used to delete one or more images from local Docker storage.



#### Example Usage:

Suppose you want to deploy a web service on your server using a Docker container. You can first download a ready-made image from Docker Hub using `docker pull`, then run it using `docker run`. If you run into problems, you can view the container logs using `docker logs`.

#### Let's take a closer look at the commonly used flags for each of the Docker commands described:

1. **docker run:**
   - `-d` (or `--detach`): Runs the container in the background (detached mode).
   - `-p` (or `--publish`): Flips ports between the container and the host machine. For example, `-p 8080:80` forwards port 8080 on the host machine to port 80 on the container.
   - `--name`: Specifies the name of the container.
   - `-e` (or `--env`): Sets the environment variables for the container.
   - `-v` (or `--volume`): Mounts volumes (directories) from the host machine into the container.
   - `-it`: Starts the container in interactive mode (connecting to the container terminal).

2. **docker pull:**.
   - There are no particular commonly used flags for this command. It is used simply to load an image from Docker Hub or another repository.

3. **docker build:**
   - `-t` (or `--tag`): Specifies the tag (name) for the image to be built.
   - `-f` (or `--file`): Specifies the path to the Dockerfile if it is not in the current directory.

4. **docker ps:**.
   - `-a` (or `--all`): Displays all containers, including stopped containers.
   - `-q` (or `--quiet`): Displays only container identifiers.

5. **docker images:**
   - `-a` (or `--all`): Displays all images, including intermediate images.
   - `-q` (or `--quiet`): Displays only image identifiers.

6. **docker logs:**.
   - `-f` (or `--follow`): Tracks log output in real time.
   - `--tail`: Limits the number of lines output from the logs.

7. **docker rm**.
   - `-f, --force`: Removes containers even if they are running.
   - `-v, --volumes`: Removes volumes bound to the container.
   
```bash
# Delete a container named "my_container"
docker rm my_container

# Delete all stopped containers
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
```

8. **docker rmi:**
   - `-f, --force`: Forcibly deletes images even if they are used by containers.
Usage examples:

```bash
# Delete an image with the tag "my_image:latest"
docker rmi my_image:latest

# Delete all unused images
docker rmi $(docker images -q -f "dangling=true")
```


These are just some of the commonly used flags for each Docker command. There are many other flags that may be useful depending on your particular situation or needs.
